##First Come First Served

#First Come First Served is the simplest scheduling algorithm. The ready list is a simple
#queue (first-in, first-out). The scheduler simply runs the first job on the queue until it blocks, then it runs
#the new first job, and so on. When a job becomes ready, it simply added to the end of the queue.

#Main advantage of FCFS is that it is easy to write and understand
#No starvation
#If one process gets into an infinite loop, it will run forever and shut out all the others
#FCFS tends to excessively favor long bursts. CPU-bound processes
